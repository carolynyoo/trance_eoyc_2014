        <h1>Trance Top 20 Songs of 2014</h1> 
        <h3>2014 was the year I discovered and fell in love with trance. It was the year I saw the beauty in listening to 10+ minute extended mixes and saw the subtleties of synths &amp; sidechaining. I fell in love with so many artists/DJs, jumped and sang along at many shows, &amp; found the wonder that is psy/tech trance (but still couldn't help the guilty pleasure of vocals). As an homage to my first year of trance, these are my most played and/or most loved songs of 2014.</h3>

Uplifting at its finest, and given fair play in radio shows/sets.">

This wasn't a favorite off the bat, but an uplifting track that really grew on me as I heard it multiple times in sets. Now I even prefer it to the club mix (if you haven't heard it, please do as it is greatly underrated!) ">

Mark Sherry brings his classic tech trance sound and Clare Stagg provides beautiful vocals. Also I am a sucker for the cheesy(?) silent breakdown.">

I don't care that it might clash, I think it works. I do love every song with Sarah Howells in existence though, so who knows..">

Also got me to look into Ferry Tayle who makes absolutely beautiful music.">

He released several songs this year but Victims is his finest/best - not necessarily for its catchiness or 'banger'ness, though those do apply, but the song just showcases how talented he is at music production.">

This is always a solid.">

Don't get me wrong, I love this song and Standerwick really takes it up a notch. Note: Jennifer Rene released tune after tune during this summer period; if it weren't for Roxanne Emery she would probably be my favorite vocalist of the year.">

The lyrics to this song are quite nice in that cheesy trance way. Not sure Lee Osborne is big yet but by the looks of this song he's very promising.">

Minimal words, just pretty lady vocal sounds. The Thrillseekers (just one man!) makes such good music: 'Find You' from this year is also a great one.">
